Titanium Stylable Hint Text Field
=================================

A Titanium Alloy Text Field that allows to set the style for it's hint text.

After having to struggle many times with creating several times a textfield and a label with funcitonalities to style the hint text, I decided to create a widget that does exactly that!

And with the help from Alloy, classes and styles can be applied!

Look at the demo for references on how to use it!
